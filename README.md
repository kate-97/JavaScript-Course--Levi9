# :smiley: Color tap game
*Welcome!* <br/><br/>
<img width = 600px src = "image/game_image.png" />

   *The goal of the game is to reach much more frames with smileys colored in the same color. <br/>
   Frames will content smileys colored in two different colors. You can change color of each smiley by clicking on him. 
   You have to change color of smileys until they aren't in the same color. <br/>
   Specially, if all smileys are already in the same color or you have just one smiley in the frame, you have only to click two times on      any smiley in the frame to continue. These lucky cases are easy points. :blush: <br/>*
   
   **⚠️ Pay attention to the time limit!** <br/><br/>
